SkillsGoGo is a groundbreaking learning app designed to revolutionize the way education is accessed and delivered.

A teacher will be able to create a new course, an MCQ quiz, and share course material like pdfs, ppts, etc.They also have the flexibility to update or delete their own courses. 

A student will be able to explore all the courses and search for a course by its name, author name, or category. 

Students can also give timer-based quizzes, our dynamic timer ensures that each MCQ question receives a dedicated one-minute response time, regardless of the number of questions in the quiz. In the end, students can view their scores.

Students can give ratings and feedback to courses, and view those given by other users which enhances the learning experience.

We have also provided an online compiler where students can practice coding.

There is a separate community tab, where a user can put questions or any relevant information and other users can reply to those posts.
